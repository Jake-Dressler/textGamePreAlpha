# World Generation

World generation is done procedurally by creating location objects. Each location object is given a random coordinate on a plane and connections are created by making the Delaunay Triangulation of the set using [d3-delaunay](https://d3js.org/d3-delaunay). Blanket changes can easily be made by changing the location object and the procedures for generating its properties.

# Name Generation

Currently forest names are done by randomly choosing words from three word lists and combining them. Town and NPC names are generated by using [Alexey Izvalov's Markov Generator](https://generalvimes.github.io/NamesGenerator/).
